# Discord-Bot

Discord bot created in [Replit](replit.com) to host it and [Uptimebot](https://uptimerobot.com/) which pings the bot every x amount of minutes to avoid the hosting to get offline (Replit hosts a code for 1 hour max).

The setup and configuration was done using this YouTube guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok
